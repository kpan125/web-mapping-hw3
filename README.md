# web-mapping-hw3

Source data for this homework was taken from the DEP Green Infrastructure location dataset, available [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/DEP-Green-Infrastructure/spjh-pz7h). Specific types (the right-of-way projects) were left out of the map because there were too many points (~10% of the 7000 point dataset is included in the map).

Code for generating legend was taken from [MapBox example here](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/updating-choropleth/).
